# Using Foundation Interchange with Bootstrap 4

I love using Bootstrap 4 rather than Foundation, but Foundation has 'Interchange' which is a great tool for minimizing code when needing to switch out images based on different screen sizes. So I have compiled a very small project that shows how to get Interchange to work with Bootstrap 4 and play nice. The Foundation CSS/JS files have been modified in order to work with Bootstrap's breakpoints.
